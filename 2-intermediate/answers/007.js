/*


OOP means Object Oriented Programming.
The basic idea of OOP is that we use objects to model our data and provide a simple way of providing functionalities that would be easy to use.
And we use objects as building blocks of our application.

OOPs concept provides some techniques namely :
    Class — A class is a blueprint for an object. It tells us how the object has been constructed and what are all the properties and methods it will have. JavaScript actually does not have class mechanism but we can use functions to act as class which will construct on object when called with new keyword.
    Encapsulation — Encapsulation means hiding the object properties from outside. This secure our internal functionalities and preventing from any unknown changes. JavaScript does not have private or access modifiers. But we can take advantage of the JavaScript lexical scope where a function’s variable is not accessible from outside.
    Inheritance — This means an object can inherit methods and properties from a parent object. JavaScript is using different inheritance system where the parent object functionalities are not copied to the children object. But rather they are prototypically linked to their parent. So, we can still use the properties and functions that are not defined in the children object but declared in the parent.
    Polymorphism — is the ability to create a variable, a function, or an object that has more than one form.
